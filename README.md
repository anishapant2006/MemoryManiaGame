Memory Mania is a browser-based, interactive card-matching application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to assess and strengthen users’ memory, concentration, and pattern-recognition abilities. The system allows players to select from multiple difficulty levels, each defined by a distinct number of cards and a corresponding time constraint. Upon starting a level, users engage in matching pairs of concealed cards under a countdown timer, requiring both accuracy and efficiency. The game keeps track of how you're doing and gives clear feedback at the end of each round, showing a congratulatory message if you finish in time or encouraging you to try again if the clock runs out. Players are then provided with the option to retry the same level or transition to an alternative level, ensuring a flexible and scalable user experience.To begin, open the index.html file in any web browser.
