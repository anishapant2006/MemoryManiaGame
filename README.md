Memory Mania is a browser-based, interactive card-matching application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to assess and strengthen users’ memory, concentration, and pattern-recognition abilities. The system allows players to select from multiple difficulty levels, each defined by a distinct number of cards and a corresponding time constraint. Upon initiating a level, users engage in matching pairs of concealed cards under a countdown timer, requiring both accuracy and efficiency. The game continuously monitors player performance and delivers formal outcome feedback at the conclusion of each session, issuing a congratulatory message upon successful completion or a prompt to attempt the level again if the allotted time expires. Players are then provided with the option to retry the same level or transition to an alternative difficulty, ensuring a flexible and scalable user experience. The application requires no installation or external dependencies; gameplay begins by opening the index.html file in any modern web browser.
